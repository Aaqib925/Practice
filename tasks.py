# Question:
# Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
# between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
#
# Hints:
# Consider use range(#begin, #end) method
#
# list1 = []
# for i in range(2000, 3201):
#     if (i % 7 == 0) and (i % 5 != 0):
#         list1.append(i)
#
# print(list1)

# Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
# The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 8

# Question:
# With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 8
# Then, the output should be:

#
# Question:
# Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 34,67,55,33,12,98
# Then, the output should be:
