# Question:
# Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
# between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
#
# Hints:
# Consider use range(#begin, #end) method
#
# list1 = []

#     if (i % 7 == 0) and (i % 5 != 0):

# Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers X, Y and Z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an
# integer N. You have to print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i, j, k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i + j + k  is not
# equal to N. Here, 0 <= i <= X; 0 <= j <= Y; 0 <= k <= Z
#
# Input Format
# Four integers X, Y, Z and N each on four separate lines, respectively.
#
# Constraints
# Print the list in lexicographic increasing order.
#
# Sample Input
# 1
# 1
# 1
# 2
#
# Sample Output
# [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]
