# program to count the number of vowels in the String

# sentence = input("Enter the String: ")
# vowels = 0
# for i in sentence:
#     if i == "a" or i == "e" or i == "i" or i == "o" or i == "u" or i == "A" or i == "E" or i == "I" or i == "O" or i == "U":
#         vowels += 1
#
# print("There are", vowels, "vowels in your String")

# Question:
# Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
# between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
# The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
#
# Hints:
# Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

# list1 = []
# for i in range(2000, 3201):
#     if (i % 7 == 0) and (i % 5 != 0):
#         list1.append(i)
#
# print(list1)


# Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
# The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 8
# Then, the output should be:
# 40320
# =========CODE============

# def fact(x):
#     """ this function calculates the factorial of the input number"""
#     if x == 0:
#         return 1
#     else:
#         return x * fact(x - 1)
#

# x = int(input("Enter any number: "))
#
# print("The factorial of", x, "is", fact(x))
