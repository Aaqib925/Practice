# build in standard types in python interpreter are as follows
# the build in principal types are the numeric, classes, instances, sequence, mapping and exceptions
# truth value testing
# every object is considered to be true unless it is made false by boolean funtion or its len() is zero
#  examples of empty sequence and collections are "", {}, (), [], set(), range(0)
# every operation has the build in return result either true or false
# 0 or False is used for the false and 1 or True is used for true
# there are also three more boolean operations in python, or, and , not
# for or.... (x or y) means if x is false then y,,,else x
# matlab wohi jo men soch rha hun...k pehle x ko dekhenge...if x is false then y
# for and...(x and y) means if x is false then x else y
# for not... (not x) means if x is false then operations says true...else false
# not wala boolean operation is for making object false i guess
# or and and are the short circuit operators...
# x or y wale operator mn sirf usi waqt y pa jaega jab x false hoga...warna nahi
# x and y wale operator mn x true hoga to y pa jaegaa
# comparison operators ...there are eight comparison operators in python
# ( < ) which is called less than... ( <= ) is less than equal to...( > ) is greater than...( >= ) is greater than equal to
#  ( = ) is used for equal to..and != is called not equal to
# ( is ) is the object identity and ( is not ) is the negated object identity
# numeric types...there are 3 numeric types in python....int, float and complex
# complex numbers contain real and imaginary parts...let z is the complex number then z.real of real part and z.imag for the
# imaginary part
# the numeric operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division...also remainder by % (modulus)
# -x  ( x is negated ) and +x ( x is unchanged )...abs(x) for absolute value or magnitude of x
# int() for integer, float() for floating point and complex(re, im) for complex number
# c.conjucate() for the conjucate of the complex numbers...pow(x, y) means y power ha x ki
# and x ** y is y is the power of x
