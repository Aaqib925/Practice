# mathematical operations in python
#print(3 + 2)
#print(3 - 2)
#print(3 * 2)
# print(3 / 2)
# print(3 // 2) # it actually drops the number after decimal
# print(3 % 2) # this modulus tells us the remainder of the two numbers

#Comparison functions

# num_1 = 3
# num_2 = 5

# print(num_1 == num_2)
# print(num_1 != num_2)  # != is used as not equal to
# print(num_1 > num_2)   # > is used as greater than
# print(num_1 >= num_2)
# print(num_1 < num_2)
# print(num_1 <= num_2)

# converting the integers into strings(method)

#number = "3"
#print("The number you written is: " + number)

# Another method(CASTING)

#num_1 = "3"
# num_2 = "4"

# num_1 = int(num_1)
# num_2 =  int(num_2)
#
# print(num_1 + num_2)
