# class is created by using keyword class and with the name of the class
# self is the prefix...which is called as object
# __init__ is called as instance
# the functions within the class are called are methods


# class human:
#     def __init__(self, name):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = 10
#
#
# person_one = human("Aaqib")  # this is passing the value to the class
# print(person_one)   # this will print the memory code in which this code is saved
# print(person_one.name)  # this will print the value

# there are 4 major concepts in OOP
# inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction

# inheritance is creating a new class within the class.... which is called derived class or child class to parent class

# the method to restrict the variables or methods within the class is called as encapsulation
# this is done by using underscore or double underscore

# Abstraction means hiding the implementation and showing the user what we want to show only
# in abstract class no instance can be created but child class can be created

# polymorphism is the ability to use the method on various objects
# example class is coloring a shape..but it can be executed for every shape

# in __init__ the first wale underscore are called initial underscore and last wale are called trailing underscore


# class registration():
#     def __init__(self, name, age, roll_no):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age
#         self.roll_no = roll_no
